//! Glazier is an operating system integration layer infrastructure layer
//! intended for high quality GUI toolkits in Rust.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use v2::{WindowId, GlazierBuilder, PlatformHandler, WindowDescription};
//! # use core::any::Any;
//! # struct Surface;
//! struct UiState {
//!     main_window_id: WindowId,
//!     main_window_surface: Option<Surface>,
//! }
//!
//! impl PlatformHandler for UiState {
//!     fn as_any(&mut self)-> { self }
//!     // ..
//! }
//!
//! let mut platform = GlazierBuilder::new();
//! let mut main_window = WindowDescription {
//! # /*
//!     logical_size: (600., 400.).into(),
//! # */
//!     ..WindowDescription::new("Main Window")
//! };
//! let main_window_id = platform.new_window(main_window);
//! let state = UiState {
//!     main_window_id,
//!     main_window_surface: None
//! };
//! platform.launch(Box::new(state), |_| ());
//!
//! ```
//!
//! It is agnostic to the
//! choice of drawing, so the client must provide that, but the goal is to
//! abstract over most of the other integration points with the underlying
//! operating system.
//!
//! `glazier` is an abstraction around a given platform UI & application
//! framework. It provides common types, which then defer to a platform-defined
//! implementation.
